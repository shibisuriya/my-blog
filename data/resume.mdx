# Work Experience

## May 2023 - Present - Software Engineer - [Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/)

Kissflow is an intuitive no-code/low-code platform that lets business users create complex
internal apps and external portals by dragging and dropping prebuilt UI elements and
configuring them.

### Custom Form Fields

'Kissflow Forms' have a carefully curated set of built-in form fields that can be used to
create most dynamic forms. However, if the builtin form fields donâ€™t fulfill users' needs,
they can develop their own form fields (Custom Form Fields) using
[kf-lcnc-sdk](https://github.com/kissflow/lcnc-sdk-js). I made major changes to the
no-code/low-code platform (both Web and PWA) to accommodate custom form fields: a
'Pro-code' functionality.

#### Scaffolding tool

- Built a CLI application using Node.js and EJS which lets users create projects (Kissflow
  custom components) that have Webpack, ESLint, Dev server, Prettier, etc. configurated to
  seamlessly work with Kissflow, so that the users can focus on developing the business
  logic of the custom component instead of worrying about setting up a project.
