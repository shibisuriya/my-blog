How do developers collaborate efficiently with non technical stake holders like designers, product managers, testers, etc.?
Obviously the devs can't ask the non technical stakeholders to clone the repository into their machines, install relavent dependecies required to run
the project, add your github remote into the cloned project, checkout the branch to which you pushed your commits and then run it... One way to address this issue is to maintain multiple environments...

The devs can make changes to the codebase and deploy the project to any one of these environments, then ask the relavent stake holders
to verify and approve the changes made...

## Problems with maintaining environments

### Long build duration

Sometimes the changes done to the codebase might be super small, for example, the dev would have just change a small piece of text...
Even though the changes that were done is very small the project needs to be built from scratch in the CI/CD pipeline... Obiviously there
are multiple reliable ways to reduce the build duration, for example, using webpack cache, etc.

Managing frontend SPA (Single Page Application) projects is super simple, you just have build the project in the pipeline and then move the `dist` generated
to a storage bucket, and expose these folders to the internet...

For example, assuming the build number to be 53 the url could be `rc53.my-dummy-org.com` and so on... So for every build triggered a folder will
be created in a storage bucket and it would exposed as

The problem with this approach is that n number of frontend projects would be pointing a single backend server...

To improving the collaboration between the backend and the frontend folks we should let backend developers deploy their
changes to different servers so that
