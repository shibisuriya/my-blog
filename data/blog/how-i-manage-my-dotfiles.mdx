# What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are hidden configuration files that are used to customize the behaviour of various programs
in Unix-based operating systems like GNU/Linux and macOS. For example, the dotfile `.zshrc`
(typically present in the user's home directory) can be used to customize the user's zsh shell.

# The problem with dotfiles

## New computers

Typically, we tend to customize the computer programs that we use on a regular basis to get our work
done faster. Customizations might range from adding a few custom key biddings or changing the
programs appearance.

## Owning multiple computers

If you own multiple computers, customizations done to a program installed on a computer won't
automatically propogate to other computers.

For example, changing your office computer's Z shell's prompt won't change the prompt of the Z shell
installed on your personal Desktop computer.

Syncing the customizations across multiple devices is the user's responsibilty... The user has to
manually compare the appropriate configuration files present in multiple computers, carefully merge
the differences, copy the new version of the configuration files to all the devices and ensure that
they work... This method of keep the configuration files in sync across multiple devices is time
consuming, tedious and risky.

## Version control

## In a quest for perfection!

The way I manage my computers/dotfiles currently might not be perfect... I am aware that the tools
and techniques that I currently use are not the absolute best, and there are better alternatives. My
current setup works for me, even if it is imperfect. I am an eternal learner, I will try hard to
keep this blog post updated or rewrite it if required as I explore and adopt new tools and
techniques since this blog post also serves as a README for my publically maintained
[dotfiles](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles) repository and as a personal reference. Feel
free to [share suggestions](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles/issues), or let
[me](https://linkedin.com/in/shibisuriya) know if youâ€™d like me to try something.

## Testing/Iterating

### UTM

[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) is program to create and manage virtual machine, it is wrapper on
QEMU.
